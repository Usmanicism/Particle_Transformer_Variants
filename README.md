# Particle Transformer Variants

This repository contains modifications to the [Particle Transformer](https://github.com/jet-universe/particle_transformer) project. It introduces two new variants of the Particle Transformer model for enhanced performance in jet tagging tasks.

## New Variants
1. **MultiAxis Particle Transformer**
2. **Swin Particle Transformer (SWAPT)**

## How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup
First, clone the following repositories and place them in the same folder:
- [Particle Transformer](https://github.com/jet-universe/particle_transformer)
- [weaver-core](https://github.com/hqucms/weaver-core)

### 2. Replacing and Adding Files
Download the files from this repository and place them as follows:

- Replace `train_JetClass.sh` in the `Particle_Transformer` folder.
- Place `example_MultiAxisParticleTransformer.py` and `example_SwinParticleTransformer.py` in the `Particle_Transformer/networks` folder.
- Place `MultiAxisParticleTransformer.py` and `SwinParticleTransformer.py` in the `weaver-core/weaver/nn/model` folder.

### 3. Running the Training
To run the training, use the following command:

```bash
./train_JetClass.sh [SWAPT|ParMat|ParT|PN|PFN|PCNN] [kin|kinpid|full] ...
```

Additional arguments can be passed directly to the weaver command, such as `--batch-size`, `--start-lr`, `--gpus`. These arguments will override existing parameters in train_JetClass.sh.
